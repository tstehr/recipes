Add liquid ingredients to dry ingredients stirring as you go. Gradually add remaining water until a cohesive dough forms. Roughly shape dough into 2-3 cm flat circle.

Let rest for ten minutes, then loosely wrap in greased aluminum foil and steam for 1 to 1.5 hours until firm and springy. Allow to cool then slice very thinly (about 1 mm slices).

For the marinade mix remaining tomato paste, soy sauce and spice blend with maple syrup and oil. Season generously with salt. Add sliced seitan and allow to marinate for at least 10 minutes up to a few days. 

To serve: Preheat pan over medium high, add seitan with marinade and fry until slightly crispy.

To freeze: Freeze in single layer on a sheet tray. When frozen pack into container. To reheat put desired amount into pan on medium and fry until thawed and slightly crispy.
