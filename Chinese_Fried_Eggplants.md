1. Cut the eggplants into small chunks . Then transfer them to a large bowl, add
   the salt and mix well to combine. Allow to soak for 15 minutes (or up to 1
   hour).
2. Then pat the eggplants dry, sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and mix
   well to coat. (If you find the eggplants too salty after soaking, you can
   also rinse them under cold running water before patting them dry.)
3. Mix all of the ingredients for the sauce in a small bowl.
4. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large non-stick pan or wok over medium heat.
   Add the eggplants and fry for about 5-8 minutes until the skin is well
   browned and the inside turns soft.
5. Add the remaining oil, ginger, garlic, and chili to the same pan and roast
   for a few seconds while stirring until fragrant. Mix the sauce again until
   the cornstarch is completely dissolved and pour it over the eggplants. Stir
   immediately until the eggplant is evenly coated and the sauce thickens.
6. Garnish the eggplants with spring onions and sesame and serve as a side dish
   or as a main course over rice or pasta with lime wedges on the side.
