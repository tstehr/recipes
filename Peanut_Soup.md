- Combine garlic, ginger, thick cilantro stems and half of the chile. Create a
  paste using a food processor or mortar and pestle. Thinly slice remaining half
  chile and set aside for garnish.
- Open 1 can of coconut milk and carefully spoon off about some of the solid fat
  from the surface and place it in a large Dutch oven. Add some vegetable oil.
  Heat over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until coconut fat separates
  and solids start to sizzle, about 4 minutes. Continue cooking, stirring
  constantly, until solids turn pale golden brown, about 1 minute longer. Add
  the garlic/ginger mixture and cook, stirring, until aromatic, about 30
  seconds. Add half of sliced scallions and turmeric and cook, stirring, until
  lightly softened, about 1 minute.
- Add remaining contents of both cans of coconut milk along with water or stock.
  Add sweet potatoes. Bring to a boil, and reduce to a bare simmer. Cook until
  sweet potatoes are totally softened, about 15 minutes. Add peanut paste
- When potatoes are fully softened, blend soup until mostly smooth but a little
  texture remains using a hand blender directly in the pot or by transferring to
  a countertop blender in batches. Bring to a simmer, stir in kale, and cook
  until kale is completely wilted and tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in lime
  juice. Season soup to taste with salt, pepper, and hot sauce. Stir in
  cilantro, reserving some for garnish. Serve soup with rice, sprinkled with
  cilantro, chopped peanuts, scallions, and sliced chiles.
