**3 servings**

- *60 ml* extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
- *1 clove* garlic
- *1/2 teaspoon* dried oregano
- *1/2 teaspoon* red pepper flakes
- *40 g* onion, roughly chopped
- *30 g* white bread, crusts removed, torn into rough pieces

- *235 ml* water or stock
- *1 tbsp* agave nectar
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1. Combine olive oil, garlic, onion, oregano, red pepper flakes, bread, tomatoes and their juices, and water or stock in the jar of a high-powered blender. Turn blender on to low speed and slowly increase speed to maximum. Blend until soup is steaming hot and completely smooth, about 4 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. If an even smoother soup is desired, press through a fine-mesh strainer or chinois before serving. Serve immediately garnished with herbs and drizzled with olive oil, or chill and serve cold. (Once chilled, you can adjust the texture by whisking in water a tablespoon at a time until desired consistency is reached.)
