# Basic Neapolitan Pizza Dough

Basic pizza dough based on [J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt's
recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/basic-neapolitan-pizza-dough-recipe). Makes
pizzas with a diameter of about 25cm, which is the largest I can bake in my home
oven.

**4 pizzas, 3 servings**

---

- *600 g* bread flour, preferably Italian-style "OO"
- *12 g* salt
- *9 g* instant yeast, such as SAF Instant Yeast
- *390 ml* water

1. Combine flour, salt, and yeast in a large bowl and whisk until homogenous.
   Add water and incorporate into flour using hands until no dry flour remains
   on bottom of bowl. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and allow to rise at
   room temperature for 8 to 12 hours. 

2. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface and divide into four even balls.
   Place them onto a floured baking sheet or tray and cover with greased plastic
   wrap. Place in refrigerator and allow to rise at least 1 more day, and up to
   4. Remove from refrigerator and allow to rest at room temperature for at
   least 1 hour before baking.
