# Salsa
Combine the onion, jalapeno, and cilantro in a food processor and pulse 5 to 7 times or until it is mostly uniformly chopped. Add the apple and the lime juice and pulse 3 to 4 more times until everything is fully combined. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate until ready to use, or up to 2 days.

# Carnitas

Preheat the oven to 200 Â°C. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread the cauliflower over the sheet and spray with olive oil. Sprinkle the cumin, chili powder, coriander, garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper over the cauliflower and toss until all the cauliflower is evenly coated with the spices. Spread out again and bake for 20 minutes, flipping the florets about halfway through to ensure even cooking. Remove from the oven.

Once there's about 10 minutes left for the cauliflower in the oven, heat the olive oil in a large shallow saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and saute until the onion is translucent and soft, 7 or 8 minutes. Add the chipotles and cook for about 1 minute before adding the cauliflower and liquid aminos. Let cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 to 15 minutes. While you're stirring, use your spatula to break up the cauliflower into smaller pieces. Once the cauliflower is soft and the liquid has been absorbed, add the lime juice and stir. Remove from the heat.

# Tacos

While the cauliflower is cooking on the stove, you can cook your tortillas. You can cook them according to their package's instructions or cook them this way: I like to heat a cast iron pan over medium heat until it's pretty hot. Then I place a tortilla in the pan and cook for 30-40 seconds before flipping it and letting it cook for another 30-40 seconds. Then I transfer it to a plate and cover the plate tightly with aluminum foil. Repeat until you've prepared as many tortillas as you need.
To assemble the tacos, sprinkle a little shredded cabbage on a tortilla. Top with carnitas, salsa, avocado or cream cheese, and radish slices. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Serve immediately. Leftover carnitas can be refrigerated in an airtight container for 3 to 4 days. Enjoy!
