# Vegan Pita Bread

*Bread, vegan*

**8 pitas**

---

## To Create The "Sponge"

- *1 pkg* Dry Active Yeast
- *250 ml* Warm Water about 90-100 degrees F
- *125 g* All Purpose Flour

## To Finish The Dough

- *1 tbsp* Olive Oil
- *1 tsp* Salt
- *250 g* Flour plus more for rolling

1. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook (or in a bowl if doing by hand), combine the sponge ingredients.  Allow to sit for 10-15 minutes and if it bubbles a little, you are good to go!  No activity?  You need new yeast ;(
2. Add the remaining ingredients to the sponge mixture and knead until a smooth, but somewhat sticky dough forms.  It's best not to add additional flour if you can help it.
3. Allow to rise covered in a warm place for 2 hours.
4. Punch down the down and form into a rectangle so that you can equally make 8 portions.  Roll each portion into a ball.  I like to stretch the dough to create a smooth top and tuck the ends under the ball.
5. Allow to rise again for 30 minutes.
6. Heat a skillet and flatten each ball, rolling into rounds on a lightly floured surface.
7. In dry skillet (if using a good non-stick skillet) or with a touch of oil if you don't have a non-stick skillet, cook the pita.  Some will puff up quite a lot, some will just bubble.  This normal.  Flip when golden brown on the first side and repeat.
