- *1000 ml* tomato sauce

- *600 g* frozen spinach
- *20 g* fresh basil leaves
- *250 g* cannelloni

1. Preheat your oven to (180C).
2. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. When hot, add in the onion and garlic, saut√© until the onion begins to soften but doesn't yet brown, about 4 minutes. Add the frozen spinach and cook until thawed.
3. Add the cooked spinach and onions to the food processor with the ricotta. Add in the basil, reserving some basil leaves for garnish. Pulse a couple of times, stopping to scrape the sides as needed until the ricotta is spotted with green throughout.
4. Spread about 1/4 of the tomato sauce in the bottom of a 9" x 13" pan.
5. Scoop the ricotta mixture into a large sealable bag and cut off the corner. Alternatively, use a pastry bag. Fill the cannelloni noodles by squeezing some of the ricotta into one end of a noodle, flipping the noodle over and filling from the other side. Lay the noodle in the baking dish with the sauce in a single layer. Repeat with the remaining noodles until the dish is full and the ricotta is used up. Don't worry about these being perfect, they are going to get smothered in tomato sauce anyways, so any messes will be hidden. Cover with the remaining tomato sauce making sure each noodle is coated in sauce.
6. Bake 30 to 35 minutes until the cannelloni are tender and the sauce is hot. (Alternatively, follow the baking directions on your pasta package, it may vary). Remove from oven and garnish with basil leaves.
