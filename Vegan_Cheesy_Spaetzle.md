## Vegan Spaetzle
1. Fill a large pot with water until it's 3/4 full and bring it to a boil.
2. Mix flour, turmeric powder and kala namak in a bowl. Add 1 cup water for the spaetzle dough and whisk until it's a sticky and slightly runny dough.
3. When the water is boiling you can put the spaetzle maker on top of the pot. Add in the dough and move the spaetzle maker up and down until all the dough is in the water.
4. The spaetzle will swim on the surface once they are ready.
5. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the spaetzle to a sieve, rinse and drain and then add them back into the pot. Now we're making the cheesy sauce and fried onions!


## Vegan Cheese Sauce
1. Heat the coconut oil or butter in a small pot on low heat.
2. Add the salt, pepper, paprika powder, curry powder & garlic powder.
3. Add the flour and whisk.
4. Add nutritional yeast, whisk again until clumpy.
5. Add the water and whisk on low heat for a few minutes. If it gets too thick you can add a little bit more water and whisk again.
6. Pour it over the spaetzle and combine. You can re-heat the spaetzle together with the vegan cheese sauce at this point.


## Fried Onions
1. Cut the onions into rings and put them in a large bowl.
2. Add the flour and salt and combine until the onions are coated.
3. Heat the frying oil in a small pot or pan, fry the onions until crispy and brown. Place them on a kitchen paper to remove excess oil before adding them to the spaetzle. Sprinkle the spaetzle with chives and enjoy!
